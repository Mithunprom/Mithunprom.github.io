									<p>Mithun is currently doing his Ph.D. in Systems and Industrial Engineering 
										at the University of Arizona. He is also doing a minor in Statistics. His research focuses on analyzing and creating the predictive model for 
										real-world industrial applications by using machine learning 
										and data mining. He uses statistical tools and techniques and 
										also has experience in Apache Spark for big data analysis. 
										He has experience in regression, classification, clustering. 
										He has done several projects involving structured and unstructured 
										data. He has experience in text analysis and image classification 
										using deep learning, anomaly detection, calibrating parameters of 
										a nonlinear system, a search of materials in a large search space 
										for the capacitor, analyzing time-series panel data, etc. </p>

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Mithunprom/Ensemble-Based-Neural-Network-for-theClassification-of-MURA-Dataset" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>An ensamble of Convolution Neural Network is used to classify the 
										abnormal xrays from the normal one. Xray images are hard to classify 
										for any models. We used a complex version of CNN to build a classification
										model. The ensamble framework boost the accuracy of the model as differnt
										CNN architecture is helpful for detecting the different types of bone fractures.

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, sentiment analysis of the tweet data is done by using
										Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). These tweets
										have multilevel and multiclass. BERT is the state of the art method
										at the moment for the NLP. With the help of BERT, we added the output 
										layer with the large vocabulary based pretrained BERT model and then fine tuned the model. The large case BERT
										is used in this project. The performance is better compared to other popular methods like 
										RNN, LSTM, GRU.

									<a href="https://github.com/Mithunprom/Imbalaced-Class-classification-by-model-Ensembling-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithm" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A classification predictive model is created in this project with the response being
										 whether the salary is in the top quartile or not. The dataset have a imbalanced class,
										, meaning one class have very few data points compared to other class. We used different 
									techniques to handle the imbalanced class like using SMOTE or upsampling or down sampling or even 
								taking into consideration of different evalution matrices. We fitted 
							different types of machine learning models to get the best predictions. Also,
						we used different evaluation metries like F1 scores, ROC-AUC to describe
					the which model works best. </p>

									<p>The dataset contains the article title along with

									visualize the data in Tableau to find some important
								characteristics of this dataset. We then created a deep learning model
							to analyze the title of each article to determine the popularlity. An
						embedding projector is also used to find the simillar words. </p>

									<p>In this project we analyzed a web traffic data for a particular

										We have been provided with the number of sessions for a 
										time series of consecutive days starting from . 
										Our task was to predict the number of sessions for the next days.</p>

									<p>Missing values in the data for the real world is a regurla thing. 
										Mostly, we drop these values of assume them with the mean or other 
										kind of statistics based on the existing data. In this project, I have used machine learning tools to predict
										the missing value in a data.
